Due to the break in the season from the Coronavirus pandemic, Liverpool claimed the unusual record of winning the Premier League earlier than any other team by games played and also later than any other team by date (being the only team to clinch the title in June). Salah continued to pile on goals for the Merseyside club, becoming the first player since Michael Owen to score 20 goals in all competitions in three straight seasons for the Reds, whilst also accruing an impressive 10 assists",
